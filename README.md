Excuse the name, I was lazy and let GitHub name it for me.

A repo for a small text-to-speech Windows form application that will allow a user to save text as a .wav file for later listening.

So I've seen a couple text to mp3 apps out there but they're kinda costly. Basically I want someone to read my (online) textbooks and notes to me on the long drives from where I live to my hometown when I visit my folks, and when I'm cooking or otherwise away from a computer or tablet. I figured it could be a fun little project on the side as well.

This app uses [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms586885(v=vs.110).aspx) reference as its messiah, since I'd be far and away lost without it. Credit to the Microsoft Developer Network.

# The Future
Perhaps I'll try to work in functionality such that someone could take a picture of physical notes, and then provide that image or images as the text source.
